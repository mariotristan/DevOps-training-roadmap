# 🧭 DevOps Enablement Program — Executive Summary

## 📌 Objective
Accelerate engineering efficiency, reliability, and velocity through a 12-week DevOps enablement track designed for cross-functional impact across cloud platforms.

---

## 🎯 Strategic Outcomes

- **Time-to-Market** Reduction  
  Automate build, test, and deploy workflows with CI/CD pipelines to speed feature delivery and shorten release cycles.

- **Operational Reliability**  
  Introduce observability, alerting, and incident response practices to minimize downtime and improve MTTR.

- **Scalable Infrastructure**  
  Implement Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and container orchestration to enable resilient, reproducible environments across dev/test/prod.

- **Security by Design**  
  Integrate DevSecOps tooling early in the lifecycle to reduce vulnerabilities and meet compliance targets.

- **Cost Optimization**  
  Apply FinOps principles across infrastructure and cloud usage to align engineering with P&L priorities.
